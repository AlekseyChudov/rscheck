# RSCheck - Real Server health Check

RSCheck is a simple daemon for checking a Real Server health before adding it to
a Load Balancing cluster.

RSCheck is useful for any kind of load balancing and health checking when you
have application or even multiple applications running on your host and want to
check all of them asynchronously and receive aggregated status over HTTP GET or
HTTP HEAD request.

It is very dangerous to add misconfigured Real Server to a L4 Load Balancing
cluster (eg. IPVS) especially when using least connection scheduler (lesser extent
but still affects other schedulers). Missing virtual IP address or rp_filter
enabled on a Real Server network interface leads to site downtime by directing
all new connections to the misconfigured server.

## Building RSCheck RPM package

You should always create RPM packages in a clean environment and preferably on a
separate machine or in container!

```shell
yum -y update
yum -y install @Development\ Tools

git clone https://github.com/AlekseyChudov/rscheck.git

cd rscheck
rpmbuild -bb rscheck.spec
```

## RSCheck usage example

```shell
yum -y update
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install rscheck

cp /usr/share/doc/rscheck*/rscheck.conf /etc/rscheck/primary-site.conf
vi /etc/rscheck/primary-site.conf

systemctl enable rscheck@primary-site
systemctl start rscheck@primary-site
systemctl status rscheck@primary-site

cp /usr/share/doc/rscheck*/rscheck.conf /etc/rscheck/dns-server.conf
vi /etc/rscheck/dns-server.conf

systemctl enable rscheck@dns-server
systemctl start rscheck@dns-server
systemctl status rscheck@dns-server

curl -v 'http://localhost:81/getstatus'
curl -v 'http://localhost:81/getstatus' -X HEAD

curl -v 'http://localhost:81/getstatus?virtual_if=tunl0&virtual_ip=1.1.1.1'
curl -v 'http://localhost:81/getstatus?virtual_if=tunl0&virtual_ip=1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2'

curl -v 'http://localhost:81/getstatus?exclude=dns-example.com,interfaces,http,tcp-443,sysclt'
```
